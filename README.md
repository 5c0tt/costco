#How to print full resolution non-jpg .tiff files at Costco Printing Center
These are instructions on how to prepare your files for printing at Costco and get the best possible resolution and results from a TIFF file instead of the lossy compressed jpg file format.

This only works on photo printing machines that use real photo chemicals to print you digital files.  A machine called a [Noritsu](http://www.noritsu.com/) is one such machine.  The document [instructions.pdf](instructions.pdf) will explain how to send TIFF files instead of JPG files so you can get zero compression artifacts.  However, as long as their equipment does not open, re-save, and re-compress the image, or re-size it, the JPG setting at a highest level would probably be imperceptible to the eye.
